# Form-NLU: Dataset for the Form Language Understanding
we introduce a new dataset for form structure understanding and key information extraction. The dataset would enable the interpretation of the form designer's specific intention and the alignment of user-written value on it. Our dataset also includes three form types: digital, printed, and handwritten, which cover diverse form appearances/layouts and deal with their noises. In this repository, we will provide detailed baseline model descriptions and experimental setups for ensuring our model and experiments are reproducable.
